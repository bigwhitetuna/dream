# Dream

The Frankenstein's monster of:
- Dreambot, a bot for Discord that uses Stability AI's API to generate images based on prompts and configurations
- DreamWeb, a website that shows all of the images generated by Dreambot, with some extra features

Brought to you by (in order of contribution):
- Chat GPT4
- Co-Pilot
- Houston

To run this thing you need:
- Discord bot, with client ID, client secret, and discord bot token
- stability ai api key

To run this thing locally, you need:
- Python 3.8
- docker-compose
- some sort of virtual environment (I use conda) - not required but helpful

To run:
- clone repo
- set up .env variables
- `cd dream`
- `sudo docker compose up --build`
  - or equivalent command for your operating system / installation
